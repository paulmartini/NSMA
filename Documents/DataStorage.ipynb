    "\n",
    "*ASCII* (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a set of 128 7-bit characters that originated with telegraph data and was first published as a standard in 1963. As one byte is 8 bins, the ASCII encoding uses 7/8 of each byte. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common ways to read and write ASCII files in python are with file.open() and with np.savetxt(). \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of files stored in ASCII format (e.g. those with a .txt extension) is that they are human readable with a text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of ASCII files is that they do not store data very efficiently. For example, to store the number \"3.1415926535\" in ASCII requires 12 bytes, one per character. In contrast, this number can be stored as a single-precision floating point number, which requires only four bytes. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Binary* format stores information in terms of ones and zeros. It is commonly used for larger quantities of numerical data where total storage space is a factor, and where there is no requirement to have an immediately human-readable file. Binary files are typically organized in groups of eight bits, or bytes. There are standard numbers of bytes used to represent numbers width different amounts of precision. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "- Single precision: This uses 32 bits or 4 bytes. Two bits for the base, one for the sign, 8 for the exponent, and 23+1 for the significand. \n",
    "- Double precision: This uses 64 bits or 8 bytes. Two bits for the base, one for the sign, 11 for the exponent, and 52+1 for the significand. \n",
    "- Signed integer: 32-bit data in the range -2147483648 to 2147483647\n",
    "- Unsigned integer: 32 bin data in the range 0 to 4294967295\n",
    "\n",
    "One common question that arises with data stored in binary format is whether the convention is *big-endian* or *little-endian.* The difference is that in little-endian format the least significant bytes  (littlest) are stored before the most significant bytes (biggest), and for big-endiant this is reversed.

    "\n",
    "FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System, a data storage format that was first standardized in 1981. FITS is the most common data format used in astronomy, and is a very effective way to store image data such as 1-D spectra, 2-D images, and 3-D data cubes, as well as tables of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind FITS is that there is a human-readable header in ASCII formation combined with data in binary format. Each fits file will contain one or more headers, and the headers (except perhaps the first) will each have an associated data block. \n",
    "\n",
    "The headers consist of a list of \"cards\" with a maximum length of 80 characters. Each of these cards consists of a keyword, a value for the keyword, and often a comment that describes the keyword. The 80 character length dates from when 80 characters was the maximum for an old punched card. Many of the keywords are standardized, such as to encode information about the coordinate system of an image (often called the World Coordinate System or WCS), the length of an exposure, date and time information about when data were obtained, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details about the FITS standard are maintained at: https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n",
