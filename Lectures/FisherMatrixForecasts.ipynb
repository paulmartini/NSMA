    "The Fisher information matrix, or simply the Fisher matrix, describes the amount of information that some observables $D$ contain about the parameters ${\\mathbf \\theta}$ of the model distribution for $D$, that is $p(D | \\theta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, the probability density function $p(D | \\theta)$ may depend strongly on $\\theta$ such that one may need relatively little data derive $\\theta$. One example is the use of parallax measurements to determine the distance to a nearby star cluster. In this case, $\\theta$ is the distance of the cluster, and one would need relatively few measurements to determine $\\theta$ reasonably well. In other words, there is a lot of information about the parameters in the observables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, the probability density function $p(D | \\theta)$ may depend only weakly on the model parameters. An example is the galaxy luminosity function. The galaxy luminosity function is typically described by a power-law, an exponential cut-off at high luminosity, and a space density. A small number of measurements, especially if confined to a small luminosity range, would not provide much of a constraint. In this case there is relatively little information about parameters in the observables. "
